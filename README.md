## Description
I am building a Node CLI that takes in information about employees and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. Given that testing is a key piece in facilitating  code to be  maintainable, I am ensuring that all unit tests pass.

The application may be invoked from the command line like so:
**node app.js**

## Installing Dependencies
 Dependencies maybe installed as follows:
 **npm i**

## Usage

The application begins by informing the user that they need to select an Engineering Team before they can view information about them.

The user then proceeds by selecting a manager, engineer, intern or team complete (when they have finished with the team selection)

Finally, the user informed of if a file has been successfully created (and it's location).
