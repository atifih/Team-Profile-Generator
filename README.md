## Description
It is important when creating open source projects on GitHub that  they posess quality README files  composed with information such as: What the app is for.   how to use the app, how to install it, how to report issues, and how other developers can lmake  contributions  to the success of the project

A command-line application was chosen as it will enable a quick and easy generation of a project README to get started promptly. This facilitates a project creator to spend more time on working on finishing the project and less time creating a good README.

My goal here is to create a command-line application  that dynamically generates a professional README.md from user input via the Inquirer package (installable as a module to the node.js application).

The application will be invoked from the command line like so:
**node index.js**

## Installing Dependencies
 Dependencies maybe installed as follows:
 **npm i**

## Usage
  
After retrieving all information relevant to generating a professional Readme file, the application will begin organzing/structuring the information under suitable headings/headers.

The application begins by prompting the user for their github username, email address followed by the title of the project.

The application prompts installation instructions as well as sensible default options as shown in this picture with the option displayed within parenthesis.

The user then proceeds in the application at which point they are prompted to select the license for the application from a list of common application licenses.

The user is then prompted to enter the  application usage information as well as guidelines on how one may contribute towards the success of this project.

Finally, a link to the developer's github profile coupled with links to their email address are provided, along with a status message from the application on whether the readme file was generated successfully.
