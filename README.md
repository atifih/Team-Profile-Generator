## Description
I am building a Node CLI that takes in information about employees and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. Given that testing is a key piece in facilitating  code to be  maintainable, I am ensuring that all unit tests pass.

The application may be invoked from the command line like so:
**node app.js**

## Installing Dependencies
 Dependencies maybe installed as follows:
 **npm i**

## Usage
  
After retrieving all information relevant to generating a professional Readme file, the application will begin organzing/structuring the information under suitable headings/headers.

The application begins by prompting the user for their github username, email address followed by the title of the project.

The application prompts installation instructions as well as sensible default options as shown in this picture with the option displayed within parenthesis.

The user then proceeds in the application at which point they are prompted to select the license for the application from a list of common application licenses.

The user is then prompted to enter the  application usage information as well as guidelines on how one may contribute towards the success of this project.

Finally, a link to the developer's github profile coupled with links to their email address are provided, along with a status message from the application on whether the readme file was generated successfully.
